The requirements are specified in terms of the percentage of information bit throughput for the downlink reference measurement channels specified in Annex A clause A.3.3.2, with the addition of the relevant parameters in Tables 8.2.1-1 and 8.2.1.3.1_A.1.3-1 and the downlink physical channel setup according to Table C.3.2-1 in Annex C.
Using this configuration the fraction of maximum throughput percentage shall meet or exceed the minimum requirements specified in Table 8.2.1.3.1_A.1.3-1 for the specified SNR. For open-loop spatial multiplexing performance with large delay CDD is specified.
