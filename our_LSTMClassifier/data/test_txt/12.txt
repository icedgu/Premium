The performance requirement for CA with LAA SCell(s) UE demodulation tests in Clause 8 are defined independent of CA configurations and bandwidth combination sets specified in Clause 5.4.2A.1. For UEs supporting different CA with LAA SCell(s) configurations and bandwidth combination sets, the applicability and test rules are defined for the tests for 2 DL CA with LAA SCell(s) in Table 8.1.2.3D-1 and in Table 8.1.2.3D-2 for 3 or more DL CA with LAA SCell(s). For simplicity, CA configuration below refers to combination of CA with LAA SCell(s) configuration and bandwidth combination set.
