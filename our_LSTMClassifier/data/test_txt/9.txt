The performance requirement for CA UE demodulation tests in Clause 8 are defined independent of CA configurations and bandwidth combination sets specified in Clause 5.4.2A.1. For UEs supporting different CA configurations and bandwidth combination sets, the applicability and test rules are defined for the tests for 2 DL CCs in Table 8.1.2.3-1, and 3 or more DL CCs in Table 8.2.2.3-2. For simplicity, CA configuration below refers to combination of CA configuration and bandwidth combination set.
