The performance requirement for TDD-FDD CA UE demodulation tests in Clause 8 are defined independent of CA configurations and bandwidth combination sets specified in Clause 5.4.2A.1. For UEs supporting different CA configurations and bandwidth combination sets, the applicability and test rules are defined for the tests for 2 DL TDD-FDD CA in Table 8.1.2.3B-1, in Table 8.1.2.3B-2 and for 3 DL TDD-FDD CA, in Table 8.1.2.3B-3 and for 4 DL TDD-FDD CA, in Table 8.1.2.3B-4 and for 5 DL TDD-FDD CA. For simplicity, CA configuration below refers to combination of CA configuration and bandwidth combination set.
