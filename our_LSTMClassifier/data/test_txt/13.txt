For 4Rx capable UEs without any 2Rx RF bands, all single carrier tests specified in 8.2 to 8.8 with 2Rx are tested on any of the 4Rx supported RF bands by duplicating the fading channel from each Tx antenna and add independent noise for each Rx antenna. Figure 8.1.2.6.1-1 shows an example of antenna connection for 4Rx UE in any one 4Rx supported RF band to perform a 2Rx performance test with antenna configuration as 2x2 without interference for information. The SNR requirements should be applied with 1.5 dB less than the number specified with 2Rx for test configuration with CRS-based TM and with 1.5 dB less than the number specified with 2Rx for test configuration with DMRS-based TM.
