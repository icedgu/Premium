The performance requirement for dual connectivity UE demodulation tests in Clause 8 are defined independent of dual connectivity configurations and bandwidth combination sets specified in Clause 5.4.2C.1. For UEs supporting different dual connectivity configurations and bandwidth combination sets, the applicability and test rules are defined for the tests for the configurations with 2CCs in Table 8.1.2.3A-1. For simplicity, dual connectivity configuration below refers to combination of dual connectivity configuration and bandwidth set.
Both CA performance requirements and dual connectivity performance requirements are applied for dual connectivity capable UE.
