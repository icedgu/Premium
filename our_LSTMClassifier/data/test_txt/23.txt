The requirements are specified in terms of the percentage of information bit throughput for the downlink reference measurement channels specified in Annex A clause A.3.3.1, with the addition of the relevant parameters in Tables 8.2.1-1, 8.2.1.1.1_A.1.3-1 and the downlink physical channel setup according to Table C.3.2-1 in Annex C.
Using this configuration the fraction of maximum throughput percentage shall meet or exceed the minimum requirements specified in Table 8.2.1.1.1_A.1.3-2 for the specified SNR. For QPSK and 64QAM performance the bandwidths specified in Table 5.4.2.1-1 are verified.
