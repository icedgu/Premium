For UE with two transmit antenna connectors in closed-loop spatial multiplexing scheme, the maximum output power is measured as the sum of the maximum output power at each UE antenna connector. For UE Power Class 3, the allowed Maximum Power Reduction (MPR) for the maximum output power in Table 6.2.2B.3-1 due to higher order modulation and transmit bandwidth configuration (resource blocks) is specified in Table 6.2.3B.3-1 with UL-MIMO configurations defined in Table 6.2.2B.3-2.
