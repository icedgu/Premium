For intra-band contiguous carrier aggregation the allowed Maximum Power Reduction (MPR) for the maximum output power in Table 6.2.2A.0-2 due to higher order modulation and contiguously allocated transmissions (resource blocks) is specified in Table 6.2.3A.1.3-1. In case the modulation format is different on different component carriers then the MPR is determined by the rules applied to higher order of those modulations.
