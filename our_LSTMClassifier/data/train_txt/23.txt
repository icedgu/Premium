For Power Class 2 UE with two transmit antenna connectors in closed-loop spatial multiplexing scheme, the maximum output power for any transmission bandwidth within the channel bandwidth is specified in Table 6.2.2B_1.3-1 with the UL-MIMO configurations specified in Table 6.2.2B.3-2. The maximum output power is measured as the sum of the maximum output power at each UE antenna connector. The period of measurement shall be at least one sub frame (1ms).
