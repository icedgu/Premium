Category NB1 UE Power Classes are specified in Table 6.2.2F-1 and define the maximum output power for any transmission bandwidth within the category NB1 channel bandwidth. For 3.75kHz sub-carrier spacing the maximum output power is defined as mean power of measurement which period is at least one slot (2ms) excluding the 2304Ts gap when UE is not transmitting. For 15kHz sub-carrier spacing the maximum output power is defined as mean power of measurement which period is at least one sub-frame (1ms).
